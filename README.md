Caesar
======

A basic Python caesar cipher program.

You can use it to:

-Encrypt a message (with a specified or a random key)

-Decrypt a message using a known key

-Crack a message without knowing the key (which involves several dictionary lookups and takes a little longer)

  -O(wc) where w = the number of words in the dictionary and c is the number of characters in the message.
